# Simple React Login Form with Validation

> A React app created using Create-React-App that consists of a login form that sends a login REST post request to this stubbed REST service: https://reqres.in. To increase the user experience of this project, I utilize local storage to persist user sessions between visits.

## Usage

- Form can be used to login or register a user.
- Due to Reqres API not accepting new data for login or register, you will need to use a valid email. Below is a list of valid options.

1. george.bluth@reqres.in
2. janet.weaver@reqres.in
3. emma.wong@reqres.in

- Submit form to sign in and get access to user profile page.
